## Introduction
Studying basic algorithms in the book "Grokking Algorithms" I decided to make a simple implementation.

## Search algorithms
are located in the file search_algorithms.py The implementation of two algorithms is shown:
* Simple search
* Binary search

## Sorting algorithms
are located in the sorting_algorithms.py file. The implementation of three algorithms is shown:
* Sort by selection
* Bubble sort
* Quick sort

## Graph algorithms
are in the file graph_algorithms.py The implementation of three algorithms is shown:
* Breadth First Search
* Depth search
* Dijkstra's algorithm
